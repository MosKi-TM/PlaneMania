# PlaneMania
This is a "clean" version of PlaneMania Script. It shows physics and how it apply forces to car but all the reverse engineering part that allows players to cheat is missing.

This is created for the Openplanet software that give the possibility to create mods for Trackmania Games. This verison is for Trackmania 2020.

PlaneMania was at first the idea of creating a Plane physics and put it in Trackamnia but after a lot's of other things to do, the project was aborted. I work a bit on it because I still like the idea and it's pretty fun.
